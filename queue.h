/*
	A FIFO queue of user-definable records.
	Items are added at the tail, and removed from the head.
	
	The record type is declared in queue-consts.h (customized per application 
	from queue-consts-template.h).
	
	Accordingly, only one queue can be used per application.
	It's defined internal to this module, and accessed only through this API.
	But, this gives substantial efficiency over a queue whose elements are sized
	at runtime, without any syntactic bloat.
	
	To facilitate efficient memory use with minimal copying,
	elements are added by first pushing a new element on the tail, then modifying it.
	
	Similarly, the head element is typically accessed and modified in place.
	So, when pushing a new element onto a full queue, you can choose whether to
	discard the oldest item (the head) or to clear the entire queue EXCEPT for the head
	(essentially, discarding the newest items but keeping the 'current' item).
	
	Sample code for adding items:
	
		PrePushQueue();
		QueueTail()->b = 5;
		PushQueue();
		
	Sample code for accessing the head and removing it:
	
		putc(QueueHead()->b);
		PopQueue();
