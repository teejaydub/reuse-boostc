/*
	Software support for Dallas 1-Wire protocol, as master.
	
	To use, define constants in onewire-const.h.
	
	And, be sure to activate either internal or external pullup on the pin.
	
	Supports up to two busses; the second bus is accessed using the *_2 functions.
	(This is primarily for coding and testing ease; it would probably be tighter
	and not significantly slower to parameterize the bus dynamically.)
