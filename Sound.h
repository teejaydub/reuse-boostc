      Requires Timer 1, and sole use of the interrupt handler for the required deterministic latency.
	
	Requires SoundConsts.h defined, from the template.

// E.g., an ascending scale is "cdefgabC".
// The default duration is an eighth note at 120 bpm.
// Duration is changed for subsequent notes using '8', '4', '2', and '1'
// for eighth, quarter, half, and whole notes (4/4), or '6' for sixteenths or '3' for thirty-seconds.
// A dot after the duration signifies a dotted note, and is reset for the next note automatically.
// Accidentals can be prefixed as '+' for sharp and '-' for flat,
// and affect only the following note.
// A space (' ') signifies a rest, and uses the current duration.
// Default is staccato; can be changed with '_' for legato and '^' for detached, which persist.
