	Stores and operates on the time of day.
	Stored in an unsigned short as minutes since midnight.
	
	One master time value is presented for use as the current time.
	You can also convert values to time types, and do math on them.
	
	Gets time from uiSeconds and uiTime.  Takes over uiSeconds's
	global 'seconds' for use as the current seconds, 0-59.
