# ReuseBoostC

Reusable modules for BoostC.

BoostC (along with its IDE, SourceBoost) is an implementation of the C language for the Microchip PIC microcontroller.

I've collected these modules over the years to aid in developing embedded projects.

Documentation is generally in the .h file.

`*-consts.template.h` files are intended to be renamed to `*-consts.h` and customized with your own settings, per-project.
